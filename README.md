## CNN Prediction on Brain Tumor MRIs
by Richard Noh and Tarini Thiagarajan 

This is our final project for CSE382M: Foundational Techniques of Machine Learning and Data Sciences. We presented prediction results on a
moderately deep convolutional neural network with binary and multiclass classification on this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset/data).
We also presented results on a rotationally-invariant CNN model, introduced in this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320323006921).
